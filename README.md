If you've followed these steps, it should be done! Changes will take restarting your WoW client to take effect.

# Uninstalling:

1. In the same `...\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\` directory, delete `GLUES`. Easy.

# Bug Reporting:

If you see any weird glitches, forgotten textures (which are listed below but aren't working in game), or weird clipping issue, report them PH Link.

# Q&A:

Q: "Will you update X addon textures?"

> A: No current plans. I can't possibly keep track of every single addon, and doing so would create unnecessary bloat for people who don't use X addon.

Q: "How long did this project take?"

> A: lol idk yet

Q: "What are the specs of the new computer?"

> A: [AMD Ryzen 7 1700X](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+1700X&id=2969), 32 GB DDR3 RAM, [GTX 1060](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+1060&id=3548). It's decently powerful and was gifted to me by a friend (which I've very thankful for in this GPU shortage time). It has boosted my working process by quite a decent amount.

Q: "Why was this made?"

> A: In the same essence of the WoW Map Uprez project, except I just dislike seeing low resolution textures in Classic clients. It's not that I want an HD Classic necessarily, but playing on a 4k monitor, it bothers me when addons, retail UI and everything else look fine and then default textures are not so good. So, I aim to eliminate that.

Q: "Why not charge money?"

> A: It's not something I like to do. This is a hobby, not a job. I do accept donations. I'm never in it for the money. Until I get my paypal set up, you can donate gold to my WoW characters. I play on US Retail servers, so sorry for any EU fans: ![alliance](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/icons/alliance.png)[Simaia-WyrmrestAccord](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/simaia) or ![horde](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/icons/horde.png)[Kaestra-WyrmrestAccord](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/kaestra).

Q: "Do you work for Blizzard?"

> A: No. Not sure if this is what I'd primarily like to work on if I did. I'd much rather work on WoW's lacking customisation options. There's some new stuff in Shadowlands coming out, but I'd like to just go all out on making more stuff - [mostly minor little things](https://twitter.com/keyboardturn/status/1197625790671622146).
